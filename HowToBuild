# Package larbatch is a null-flavored package that can not currently
# be built properly using standard mrb build tools (mrbsetenv, mrb
# build, mrb install).  Follow these instructions to build larbatch by
# hand.

# If you checked out larbatch using "mrb gitCheckout larbatch", then
# you should move it to a different directory that is not underneath
# your $MRB_SOURCE, so that the mrb build system will not see it.

# To build larbatch, execute the following commands in the top
# larbatch source directory (you can source this file).  Note that you
# need to have a separate build area from your normal mrb build area,
# as well as a separate source area.

# After building larbatch following these instructions, larbatch
# should be installed as a normal null-flavored ups product in your
# $MRB_INSTALL area.  Normal setup commands like "setup larbatch
# <version>" (without qualifiers) and "mrbslp" should work.
